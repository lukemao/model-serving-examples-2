- ~~Reliability is not clearly defined; some readers might think that there are bugs in the different implementations, but I think you mean robustness in the face of stress testing. This needs to be mentioned in the first parts of the paper.~~
- ~~In the first part of the paper (before our recommendations) a short intro to the four platforms considered that clarifies the differences between them  in terms of their general properties and expected use cases  is needed.~~
- ~~There is a section that excludes exploration of AI Platform, however later in the paper AI Platform is evaluated and added to the decision tree (fig 4), this needs resolving.~~
- ~~I think that the sections on costing should be moved to after the sections with the deployment examples – as this illustrates the mechanism of setting up each service first before we get to discussions and decision trees.  In the Pricing section there is a good discussion, I think that the cost/value discussions should be after this and you should review them in light of the pricing discussion and the detailed comments I have made below.~~
- ~~In the section before figure 3 there is a claim that CR and CF are more cost efficient than AE. I believe that this is the case for short lived bursty applications but may not be the case for applications where it is possible to feed a steady workload to AE for a long duration reducing idle time to a minimal level. This claim should be quantified – at what point is it that CF/Cr become more cost effective to deploy a language model?~~
- ~~“Degree of concurrency considerations” the claim that leveraging cloud run for high degrees of concurrency is cheaper needs to be quantified – at what point does it become cheaper? Or is it always cheaper – how much cheaper? I see that this is covered in figure 18 and so if this section is moved below pricing and fig 18 you can refer to this as evidence?~~
- ~~I think that the decision trees (which are a great idea btw) should be introduced after the pricing and cost sections and before the conclusion with the associated discussion to justify them (in a “Discussion” section).~~
- ~~In conclusions you mention that you have explored 3 serverless options but obviously as discussed you have four options in figure 4.~~
